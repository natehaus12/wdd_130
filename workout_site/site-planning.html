        Getting in shape can not only be difficult, but it can be scary! While some walk into a gym and 
        feel like they are at home, some of us walk in and have feelings of fear, anxiety, and overwhelmingness.
        If you are one of these people, no need to worry. There are millions of people that feel the same as 
        you. Here we will break down some basic ways to workout and diet that will help you get closer to the
        look you desire.

        First thing you need to understand is getting in shape is a process! It will take time, and it will
        challenge you mentally and physically. You may have days that you feel you cannot do it, but 
        remember consistency is key! Do not hold yourself to a workout schedule or diet you cannot do
        consistently. It is much better to workout for 30 mins a day, and reward yourself with an unhealthy
        snack once a day for a month in row, rather than workout 3 hours a day and eat no sugar for 5 days,
        and then splurge on 3 pounds of ice cream the next day. Stick to a reasonable routine.

        The next thing you need to do is decide what your goal is.

      <h3>[Page 2]</h3>
      <p>
        When you say you want to gain weight, some may look at you funny. There is a false belief in the
        fitness industry that gaining weight is bad. Gaining weight is completely healthy, as long as you
        do it the right way!

        First thing we need to address is diet. In order to gain weight you must eat in a caloric surplus. 
        A caloric surplus means you are eating more calories than your body burns throughout the day.  
        Click here for a calorie intake calculator. This can be difficult to do during the day. Start by adding 
        a little more protein and carbs to each meal. You want to focus on carbs like rice, potatoes, oatmeal, 
        fruits, and vegetables. You also want to focus on eating protein. Some good proteins to eat are whey 
        protein powder, chicken, beef, and fish.

        Next thing we need to address is your workout routine. You are going to want to focus your workouts 
        more around lifting weights, rather than doing cardio. Workout as much as possible, but don’t push 
        yourself too hard. Click here for different workout splits you can try out. At the end of the day, 
        do what works for you!

      <h3>[Page 3]</h3>
      <p>
        Losing weight can be difficult both physically and mentally. Remember what we already address. Be 
        patient and consistent and the results will come. Try not to focus too much on the scale and focus on 
        simply making progress.

        First thing we need to address is your diet. In order to lose weight you need to eat in a caloric 
        deficit. This means that you eat less calories than your body burns throughout the day. This allows
        your body to start to burn calories stored in fat for energy, and you will lose weight. You should 
        focus on eating lots of fruits and vegetables and lean protein (lean ground beef, chicken, fish). 
        Remember, plan a diet you can stick to. It is not the end of the world to eat a few sweets here and 
        there, just don’t go overboard!

        Next, we need to address your workout routine. You will want to focus your workouts mostly around 
        cardio. This includes running on the treadmill, riding a bike, doing the elliptical, and doing the 
        stair stepper. You can also include HIIT workouts. Click here for some cardio workout ideas. More 
        than anything, do not overwork yourself. Workout as much as you can take, and no more than that.
