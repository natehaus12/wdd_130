    <p>
        Losing weight can be difficult both physically and mentally. Remember what we already address. Be 
        patient and consistent and the results will come. Try not to focus too much on the scale and focus on 
        simply making progress.
        
        First thing we need to address is your diet. In order to lose weight you need to eat in a caloric 
        deficit. This means that you eat less calories than your body burns throughout the day. This allows
        your body to start to burn calories stored in fat for energy, and you will lose weight. You should 
        focus on eating lots of fruits and vegetables and lean protein (lean ground beef, chicken, fish). 
        Remember, plan a diet you can stick to. It is not the end of the world to eat a few sweets here and 
        there, just donâ€™t go overboard!
    
        Next, we need to address your workout routine. You will want to focus your workouts mostly around 
        cardio. This includes running on the treadmill, riding a bike, doing the elliptical, and doing the 
        stair stepper. You can also include HIIT workouts. Click here for some cardio workout ideas. More 
        than anything, do not overwork yourself. Workout as much as you can take, and no more than that.
