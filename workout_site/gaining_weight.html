    <p>
        When you say you want to gain weight, some may look at you funny. There is a false belief in the
        fitness industry that gaining weight is bad. Gaining weight is completely healthy, as long as you
        do it the right way!

        First thing we need to address is diet. In order to gain weight you must eat in a caloric surplus. 
        A caloric surplus means you are eating more calories than your body burns throughout the day.  
        Click here for a calorie intake calculator. This can be difficult to do during the day. Start by adding 
        a little more protein and carbs to each meal. You want to focus on carbs like rice, potatoes, oatmeal, 
        fruits, and vegetables. You also want to focus on eating protein. Some good proteins to eat are whey 
        protein powder, chicken, beef, and fish.

        Next thing we need to address is your workout routine. You are going to want to focus your workouts 
        more around lifting weights, rather than doing cardio. Workout as much as possible, but donâ€™t push 
        yourself too hard. Click here for different workout splits you can try out. At the end of the day, 
        do what works for you!
