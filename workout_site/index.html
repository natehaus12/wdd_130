        Getting in shape can not only be difficult, but it can be scary! While some walk into a gym and 
        feel like they are at home, some of us walk in and have feelings of fear, anxiety, and overwhelmingness.
        If you are one of these people, no need to worry. There are millions of people that feel the same as 
        you. Here we will break down some basic ways to workout and diet that will help you get closer to the
        look you desire.
        <br>

        First thing you need to understand is getting in shape is a process! It will take time, and it will
        challenge you mentally and physically. You may have days that you feel you cannot do it, but 
        remember consistency is key! Do not hold yourself to a workout schedule or diet you cannot do
        consistently. It is much better to workout for 30 mins a day, and reward yourself with an unhealthy
        snack once a day for a month in row, rather than workout 3 hours a day and eat no sugar for 5 days,
        and then splurge on 3 pounds of ice cream the next day. Stick to a reasonable routine.
        <br>

        The next thing you need to do is decide what your goal is.
